# Student Management System

A Java-based **Student Management System** demonstrating **OOP principles** such as **encapsulation, classes, and objects**, while performing **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update) using arrays.

## 🚀 Features:
- **Create**: Add student records (Roll Number, Name, Age, Grade).
- **Read**: Retrieve student details using Roll Number.
- **Update**: Modify student details (Name, Age, or Grade).
- **Delete**: Not explicitly implemented but can be handled by overwriting data.

## 🏗 OOP Concepts Used:
- **Encapsulation**: Student attributes (`roll_no`, `name`, `age`, `grade`) are private and accessed via getter/setter methods.
- **Classes & Objects**: Separate classes for `Student`, `StudentManagement`, and `Main` for modularity.
- **Abstraction**: `StudentManagement` class abstracts internal storage and operations.

## 🛠 Technologies Used:
- **Java**
- **Arrays (for student storage)**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
